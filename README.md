Project Title:

Predicting Next-Month Inflation Using Economic Feature Discovery and Machine Learning

Overview

This project explores whether broader economic patterns can improve predictions of next-month inflation. The analysis is structured in two phases. Phase One focuses on feature discovery using Principal Component Analysis to uncover underlying economic forces. Phase Two evaluates whether these discovered features enhance predictive model performance.
